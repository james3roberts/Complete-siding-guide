# Complete-siding-guide
A complete guide to siding a house from start to finish. Including papering and windows as well as tools needed. 
I do not really know what my end goal will be.
I figured that if I can get all of my ideas into a script then I will just go from there and see what happens. I hope one day this will be 
used as a trainning tool to help small businesses. After this project is complete I think that i will try to make a test of sorts so that 
owners and leaders will have a clue where the new people are at with there skills. Also just by going through this they will have heard it
so If there is a way to access this while on the job then they will be able to get quick updates on what they are suppoosed to be doing.
